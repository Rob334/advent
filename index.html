        <p>I know what you are thinking...  when did Rob have time to make a website for me? 
            What is this madness and how does he even know how to do that??
        </p>
        <p>
            Well... Remember <strong>THIS GUY??</strong>

        <p class="intro">
            That's right. The world has gone mad. It's been AAAGES since the last one of these - I have got 2 whole months to catch you up on.
            I have been keeping a sort of track, but the truth is, these have been the slowest 2 months of our dating lives! <br><br>
            I had hoped that by the time this came around we would be through the worst of the disruption, but that is just not the 
            case. We have, however, become a little more used to where we are. <br><br>
            We have over the last 8 weeks or so lived together for about half of them. It has been difficult having so little to do, but, 
            touch wood, everything is going fairly smoothly. We get on and have come to a nice balance when we live together 
            and I think we are pretty happy. I am certainly happier with you than I am without! <br><br>
            We spoke a lot if you remember about making sure that we dont associate the crappy boring world we are in with being 
            in a boring relationship, and on the whole we are doing well. <br><br>
            I think, you have been a little more uncertain in our relationship than before. You have been a little worried about 
            me being bored and walking away. This is a little tough on my part because although undoubtably there is an element 
            of truth to me being bored, it has not changed how I feel about you and that I want to be with you :) I will try harder over 
            the next few weeks to give you some more assurances in this. 
        </p>
        <p class="activities">
            So to give you a little reminder of the the things we did to get us through, in no particular order...
        </p>

        <h3 class="devon"> <span>Devon to see Jan</span> </h3>
        <p>Didn't go</p>

        <h3 class="sorry"><span>Sorry!</span> </h3>
        <p>Played a lot. I won most. Then you won a load. I think I'm probably still up</p>
        
        <h3 class="wine"><span>Descovered the best app</span> </h3>
        <p>Wine. To our door. In 30 minutes. This app may well be the best app since Uber...</p>

        <h3 class="drink"><span>Drank the wine</span> </h3>
        <p>With little else taking up evenings the wine consumption has definitely headed firmly north</p>

        <h3 class="disney"><span>Some quality films</span> </h3>
        <p>You got Disney+, and we got some great value from it. Money well spent. Marvel films for the win!</p>

        <h3 class="sexandcity"><span>Sex & the City</span> </h3>
        <p>You watched this and put up with me coming into a filme that came at the end of multiple series of a TV show 
            and asking you to explain the whole thing to me.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sleep"><span>Sleepless nights</span> </h3>
        <p>A lot of trouble sleeping. I kept you awake a lot to start with. Sorry...</p>

        <h3 class="study"><span>Extra Curricular Learning</span> </h3>
        <p>You took up a course from Harvard on Environmnetal Studies and I am making some progess on this html stuff. 
            You have been pushing you science knowledge - but so far seem on top of it!
        </p>

        <h3 class="garden"><span>Gardening</span> </h3>
        <p>Sheered that bush and made the front garden into what has been referred to as the Hyde Park of Balham</p>

        <h3 class="fall"><span>Pallett had a fall</span></h3>
        <p>She broke both elbows and a wrist. She is in 2 slings. And VERY dependent on me. This is going to make the next few weeks 
            a little challenging to get as much face time in...
        </p>

        <h3 class="wcommon"><span>Wandsworth Common</span> </h3>
        <p>Visited a lot. Did a bit of our own little nature watch with the ducklings</p>

        <h3 class="tcommon"><span>Tooting Bec Common</span> </h3>
        <p>Yeah we branched out and found that one too</p>

        <h3 class="chef"><span>Became absolute master chefs</span> </h3>
        <p>Who knew we had it in us to create...</p>

        <h3 class="chillie"><span>The worlds greatest Chillie Pie</span> </h3>
        <p>Who even knew this was a thing?! A wrap around it, revolutionary! You are welcome...</p>

        <h3 class="lemon"><span>A Merry Berry standard Lemon Meringue Pie</span> </h3>
        <p>You really outdid yourself here. The meringue was perfect</p>

        <h3 class="cake"><span>The cupcakes to rule them all</span> </h3>
        <p>In case you can't remember - the ones that look like they were designed for the Ritz were by you. The ones that look 
            to have been designed by a cocolholic 5 year old were mine.
        </p>

        <h3 class="homous"><span>Houmous</span> </h3>
        <p>We ate so much houmous. Sweet Chillie houmous by the truck load.</p>

        <h3 class="milk"><span>Milk Frother</span> </h3>
        <p>My attempt to ansewer the coffee concerns were to buy this. I then made 2 of the worst coffees ever for us 
            (retailing at £18 of capital milk frother cost), and have not touched it again since. This also came off the back
            of me burning the bottom bialetti to oblivian. Sorry for htat one...
        </p>

        <h3 class="coffee"><span>Had our first coffee for weeks</span> </h3>
        <p>We found that guy selling coffee between tooting bec common and wandsworth common. I had an iced latte that was 
            alright. You had a flat white and it was awful. By this stage the whole coffee thing is just tragic...
        </p>

        <h3 class="zoom"><span>So many fun virtual games</span> </h3>
        <p>Codenames and Werewolves have become weekly occurances.</p>

        <h3 class="quiz"><span>Qizzes by the million</span> </h3>
        <p>The group quiz on Saturdays that we started really took off. Your family quiz is also going strong (though admittedly 
            I don't do too well in these ones!). My friends back home also have a weekly one. By this stage I am completely done 
            with quizzes and will be glad to see the back of them!
        </p>

        <h3 class="attic"><span>Shut the attic door</span> </h3>
        <p>Approximately 72,456,216 times and still counting</p>

        <h3 class="pot"><span>Pot night</span> </h3>
        <p>It was tragic, and after a year of dating you finally were shown my 'death position'</p>

        <h3 class="lights"><span>Wine bottle lights</span> </h3>
        <p>Basically because it was bvecoming embarrasing how many wine bottles we were recycling, we turned 
            a whole load of them into cute fairly lights. Also becuase I still live life in the knowledge that the more fairy 
            lights you can see the happier you are :)
        </p>

        <h3 class="house"><span>Lined up a great purchase</span> </h3>
        <p>You found a house for us to buy that was £720,000 and so dreamy :) I really hope we do end up in a place like that 
            at some point fairly soon...
        </p>

        <h3 class="hair"><span>You cut my hair</span></h3>
        <p>and the result was brilliant, even if the experience was thoroughly traumatic hearing you say "oops" every minute or two... </p>
